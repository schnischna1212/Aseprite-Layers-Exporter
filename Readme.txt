AsePrite Layers Exporter
========================
This is a very simple helper produced for single use for my toolchain. It may work, may not. 

No support for functionality and further development.

Tested with Aseprite 1.1.4.1.

Goal of the little Tool: 
Export one or more AsePrite files in multiple PNG files per Layer. 

How it works:
- Add your AseFiles and desired configuation to "AseFileConfiguration.json" (for example, by using http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/)
- If needed
	- Set the FilePath to your AsePrite installation in App.config (for exmple: c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Aseprite\\Aseprite.exe)
	- Set the FileName to your AseFileConfiguration.Json file (for example AseFileConfiguration-Demo.json)
- Run the Tool and enjoy
